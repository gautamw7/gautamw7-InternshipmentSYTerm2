When training a machine learning model, what is the role of validation data?
a) To assess the model's performance on unseen data (Answer)
b) To clean and pre-process the data
c) To train the initial weights and biases in the model
d) To visualize the data for better understanding

What is the term for the process of evaluating a machine learning model's performance on unseen data?
a) Training
b) Testing (Answer)
c) Validation
d) Deployment

Consider the following Python code snippet:

Python
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression

# Load and pre-process data (omitted for brevity)
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = ...

# Create and train a linear regression model
model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Make predictions on the test data
y_predicted = model.predict(X_test)


# Make predictions on the test data
y_predicted = model.predict(X_test)
Use code with caution.
