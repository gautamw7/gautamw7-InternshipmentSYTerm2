Web Development Test (10 Minutes)
Instructions: This test consists of 10 questions. The first 7 are multiple-choice questions (MCQs) and the last 3 require short coding solutions (within 10 points each) demonstrating your understanding of web development concepts. Choose the best answer for MCQs. Allow yourself 10 minutes to complete the test.

Good Luck!

Easy (MCQ):

What is the primary purpose of HTML in web development?
a) To add styling and interactivity to a web page
b) To define the structure and content of a web page (Answer)
c) To execute complex logic on the server-side
d) To create reusable components for web applications

Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) are used for:
a)  Adding data to web pages
b)  Providing a structured way to organize content (HTML's role)
c)  Defining the presentation and layout of a web page (Answer)
d)  Creating interactive elements on a web page (JavaScript's role)

What is the difference between client-side and server-side scripting in web development?
a) Client-side scripts run on the user's browser, while server-side scripts run on the web server. (Answer)
b) Client-side scripts are slower than server-side scripts.
c) Client-side scripts can only access user data, while server-side scripts can access both user data and server resources.
d) Client-side scripts are written in HTML, while server-side scripts are written in JavaScript.

Medium (MCQ):

What is the most common way to include external JavaScript code in an HTML document?
a) By embedding the script directly within HTML tags (e.g., <script> tag) (Answer)
b) By linking to the JavaScript file using the <link> tag
c) By storing the code within the <head> section of the HTML document
d) All of the above (Technically possible, but using <script> is most common)

Coding Question (Medium):

Analyze the following JavaScript code snippet and answer the questions below:

function createListElements(data) {
  const listItems = [];
  for (const item of data) {
    const listItem = document.createElement("li");
    listItem.textContent = item;
    // ... (missing code) ...
    listItems.push(listItem);
  }
  return listItems;
}

// Example usage (assuming data is an array of strings)
const fruits = ["apple", "banana", "orange"];
const fruitListItems = createListElements(fruits);
MCQ questions based on the Code Snippet:

a) What is the functionality likely missing in the ... (missing code) ... section?
i) Appending the list item (listItem) to an existing list element in the HTML document (Possible Answer)
ii) Adding a class name to the list item for styling purposes. (Possible Answer)
iii) Converting the list items (listItems) array into a string before returning. (Not Likely)

b) How could you modify the code to create an ordered list (OL) instead of an unordered list (UL)?
i) Change the document.createElement("li") line to document.createElement("ol"). (Incorrect - OL goes inside the UL)
ii) Wrap the returned listItems array in an <ol> element within the function. (Possible Answer)
iii) Change the type of the data parameter to a specific list format. (Not necessary)

Hard (MCQ + Coding):

What is the purpose of a web application framework (e.g., React, Angular, Vue.js)?
a) To provide a structured approach for building complex web applications (Answer)
b) To simplify the process of server-side scripting
c) To handle all user authentication and authorization tasks
d) To automatically generate web page content from a database
Coding Question (Hard):

Write a short JavaScript function that takes a string as input and returns a new string with all vowels (a, e, i, o, u) removed. (10 points)
removeVowels("Hello World!")  // Should return "Hll Wrld!"
